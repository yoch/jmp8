  abstract  = {We have built a simple corpus-based system to estimate words similarity in
	multiple languages with a count-based approach. After training on Wikipedia
	corpora, our system was evaluated on the multilingual subtask of SemEval-2017
	Task 2 and achieved a good level of performance, despite its great simplicity.
	Our results tend to demonstrate the power of the distributional approach in
	semantic similarity tasks, even without knowledge of the underlying language.
	We also show that dimensionality reduction has a considerable impact on the
	results.},
